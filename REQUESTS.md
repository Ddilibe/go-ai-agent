# Stage 3 Backend Task – Build and Integrate AI Agents
Welcome to Stage 3.

You're going to build AI agents and hook them up to Telex.im. We want to see how you design intelligent systems, handle integrations, and structure your code.

Getting Access to Telex.im

You need access to the Telex organisation first.

Run this command: `/telex-invite your-email@example.com`  (same way you make submissions)

Swap in your actual email. You'll get added to the organisation and can start testing.

## **What You're Building**

Create an AI agent that does something useful. Pick a task, solve a problem, help users.

Ideas:
- Code helper that assists developers on Telex
- Task tracker that reminds people about their projects
- Bot that summarises data or automates chat responses


Build it. Connect it to Telex.im. Make it talk to users on the platform.

## **Technical Requirements**

### TypeScript / JavaScript Developers:

You're required to use Mastra. This isn't optional.
What you need to do:
- Set up a Mastra agent
- Define what it does and how it behaves
- Connect it to Telex.im using the A2A protocol with proper JSON formatting
- To view the interactions with your agents go to https://api.telex.im/agent-logs/{channel-id}.txt

The channel-id is the first UUID on the address bar https://telex.im/telex-im/home/colleagues/01989dec-0d08-71ee-9017-00e4556e1942/01989dec-01be-71ee-a273-7744838298d6

Example

https://api.telex.im/agent-logs/01989dec-0d08-71ee-9017-00e4556e1942.txt

Note on workflow JSON: For node positions in your workflow, use any positive integers. Example:
```json
"position": [
  816,
  -112  // any integer works
]
```

### Other Languages (Python, Go, Java, Rust, C#, PHP, etc.):
Build your agent from scratch. Pick any framework or library you want.

What you need to do:

- Write the core logic
- Handle incoming messages
- Create endpoints that work with Telex.im

Your API needs to be clean and talk to the platform without breaking.

Integration Requirements

- Your agent needs to:
    - Respond to messages or events from Telex.im
    - Send back valid responses or actions
    - Use REST or WebSocket (keep it simple and consistent)
    - Handle errors properly and validate responses
- You need to provide:
    - A public endpoint or repo we can test
- Deliverables
    - Working AI agent
    - Telex.im integration (fully connected)
    - Live demo or API endpoint we can hit
    - Documentation explaining what it does and how to run it
    - Blog post about your integration process (especially if you used Mastra - walk through how you did it, what worked, what didn't)
    - Tweet about your agent and share what you built
        - TypeScript/JavaScript developers: Tag @mastra in your tweet
        - All other languages: Tag @hnginternship and @teleximapp in your tweet

#### How We'll Evaluate This
- Does your agent work well? Is it smart?
- Integration quality with <a href="Telex.im">Telex.im</a>
- Code structure and documentation
- Creativity (build something interesting)
- Error handling and testing
- Quality of your blog post and how well you explain your process
- Submission
- You can implement this in any language of your choice (eg Fortran, C, Assembly etc)
- Use the command `/submit` in `stage-3-backend` and fill in the requirements

That's it. Show us how you think and build. This isn't about basic CRUD anymore.
Build something cool for <a href="Telex.im">Telex.im</a>.

May the wind be always at your back

Good luck, Backend Wizards! 🚀
